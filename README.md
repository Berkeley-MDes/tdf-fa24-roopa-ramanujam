Hi! I'm an MDes student at Berkeley, learning how to make cool things and keeping track of my progress here!

# Week 1: September 5, 2024 #

This week, I focused on getting into the rhythm of school and TDF!

I'm brand new to both laser-cutting and 3d printing, so I decided to focus on learning/practicing laser cutting for this week. 

During one of our warm-up activities for Studio Foundations, we had to draw a portrait of the person sitting next to us. I loved the portrait that Shanna drew of me so much, I decided to etch it into plywood as my first laser cutting project.

Original drawing:

I worked with a Jacobs design specialist to convert the drawing into a grayscale, vectorized image in Adobe Illustrator, which provided the template to the laser cutter. I played with different laser settings to find an optimal setting for etching the drawing.

LATER THAT WEEK...

After hearing my cohort-mates talk about some of their laser-cut projects, I felt inspired to try another one. This time, I wanted to focus on cutting out interesting shapes rather than etching. In the spirit of our first assignment, I decided to make a phone stand.

My constraints with laser cutting a phone stand were as follows:
- Shape: essentially 2d objects needed to be cut and put together to create a 3d phone stand
- Materials: I didn't want to pay for material, so I used Jacobs scrap material - found a thn but durable black acrylic sheet.

Keeping these constraints in mind, I decided to make a phone stand that looked like a mini easel (example below - source: Instacart.com). I knew that my design and laser cut shapes would need to have slots to fit together since I didn't want to use hinges or other joinery.

I found a laser cut template online ([link](https://community.glowforge.com/t/picture-stand/10458)), which I converted into something cut-able in Adobe Illustrator.

I experimented with cutting out a bunch of different sizes of the template before landing on a size that supported my own phone well.

A decent-sized phone stand:

I even tested it with Lauryn's phone (kind of a fail):

There was room for improvement. For one, due to the lack of back support, the stand was front-heavy. It also didn't support different sizes of phones very well. Cody (design specialist) suggested adding some back support to my design and showed me an example of a laptop stand he had cut for himself which informed my second iteration.

I decided to modify the original template to better suit these needs. I extended the design to make it symmetrial (adding back support), and adjusted the size of the slots (adding wiggleroom to make the stand narrower or wider) I also made the curved ends a little longer so that the phone wouldn't slide out as easily. The result was the following:

Side by side of prototype stages:

Flat:

Much improved! I still need to find more users to test this version with.


Overall, I was able to practice iteration and prototyping through this exercise. I really enjoyed it. I think something I could improve on is prototyping a little more rapidly and giving myself a timebox (I could iterate on this design forever).

I also got started with some Rhino tutorials, but I have a lot more to go through before I start to feel comfortable (I probably could have redirected some of the laser cutting time to learning Rhino). 

One of my goals before the weekend s to 3d print something simple!
